"Is COVID-19 a threat from mail, shipments, or products?","There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads. Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most
often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be
spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
"
"In the United States, am I at risk for COVID-19?","This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily
"
"Is it safe for me to attend a funeral or visitation for someone who died of COVID-19?

","There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the
body of someone who died of COVID-19.
"
"Is it ok for me to touch someone who has died of COVID-19 after they have died?
","COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to
mainly spread from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19. The virus
likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to
how in uenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who
are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. This type of spread is not a concern after death.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then
touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads"
Are Africans at a lower risk of developing COVID-19 than those of other races?,"Many myths have started to evolve around COVID-19. One of them states that Africans are immune against the virus. Do not believe in such myths. This disease does not discriminate anybody. Already, over 35 African countries have reported confirmed cases of the COVID-19 disease, a clear sign that none is safe unless strict protective precautions are undertaken."
Is it possible to prevent or treat COVID-19 using antibiotics?,"No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.?"
Is there a link between COVID toes and blood clotting?,"Yes. People with coronavirus have the ability to form clots more easily, and one place you can get clots is in the small blood vessels that supply your toes. That¡¯s what¡¯s responsible for the purple toes you are seeing¡ªthe discoloration is because they are being deprived of blood flow."
Are COVID tests prone to false negatives?,"A false negative would mean that you actually have the disease but you get a negative test result. It¡¯s a falsely negative test that should have been positive. In a clinical setting, doctors and nurses have reported negative tests despite seeing compelling cases of COVID on a CT scan or the way someone presents. They proceed as though it is a positive diagnosis. "
Are my pets in danger of being ill?,"Some animals, like ferrets and maybe cats, are susceptible to this virus. Dogs were shown to be more resistant. The recommendations right now are to keep your distance from pets if you are diagnosed with COVID-19. The good news is we don¡¯t think that pets are very likely to get sick if they are actually exposed to or infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. But out of an abundance of caution¡ªsince we don¡¯t know this virus well just yet¡ªit¡¯s a good idea to play it safe. "
Is it true that COVID-19 patients who have recovered are immune to the virus?,It is still too early for a final answer
Are persons who are ill more likely to be immune than those who haven't had any symptoms?,"It¡¯s possible, but we don¡¯t know that yet and it¡¯s one of the open questions about immunity: whether a worse infection gives you a better immune response. "
"Is it true that persons with disabilities are at a higher risk?
","Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from
COVID-19. Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of
their underlying medical condition. People with certain disabilities might experience higher rates of chronic health conditions that put them at higher risk of serious illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19. Adults with disabilities are three times more likely to have heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer than adults without disabilities. You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
"
"Is COVID-19 more dangerous for persons who have high blood pressure (hypertension)?
","At this time, we do not think that people with high blood pressure and no other underlying health conditions are more
likely than others to get severely ill from COVID-19. Although many people who have gotten severely ill from COVID-19
have high blood pressure, they are often older or have other medical conditions like obesity, diabetes, and serious
heart conditions that place them at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
"
"Is it safe to adopt a pet from a shelter?
","Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to
be low. There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a signi cant role in spreading the
virus that causes COVID-19.
"
Are pregnant women more susceptible to COVID-19?,At present there is no evidence that they are at higher risk of severe illness than the general population.
Are the people who live in homeless shelters a vulnerable group?,"Homeless shelters are often overcrowded and understaffed, making it difficult to properly enforce social distancing and appropriate hygiene measures, so individuals living in shelters¡ªand unhoused individuals more broadly¡ªare at high risk for contracting COVID-19"
"Are the people who live in homeless shelters a vulnerable group?
","No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confrmed COVID-19 have
generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever,
runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. It¡¯s not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special
healthcare needs

"
Is it possible for local manufacturers and hobbyist 3D printers to provide suitable PPE for medical personnel?,It¡¯s very hard to make health care-ready PPE. Local businesses and hobbyists should be advised to manufacture for the public market than try to make health care-quality masks. Other local industries may have stockpiles of certified equipment that could go to health care workers. The community can come together to make masks and other protective equipment for essential workers outside health care. 
"If I have COVID-19, are there any drugs I should avoid?
","Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of
COVID-19. People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their
healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible. Any changes to your
medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.
"
Is it possible to prevent or cure COVID-19 using medications or therapies?,"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease.?"
"Are there different coronavirus ""species"" like there are for Ebola?","Among the thousands of samples of the long strand of RNA that makes up the coronavirus, 11 mutations have become fairly common. But as far as we know, it¡¯s the same virus infecting people all over the world, meaning that only one ¡°strain¡± of the virus exists."
Is there a way to help elderly who don't have access to the internet to get food delivered?,"Look for ways to identify at-risk people and get groceries delivered to their homes. If they have to go out, they should be social distancing in the grocery store and practicing hygiene. The handles on shopping carts, for example, are potentially a source of infection even if the store is empty. "
Are women who use oral contraceptives have a higher risk of COVID-19-related blood clotting?,"There is an elevated risk of clotting from oral contraceptives. COVID will synergize with whatever other propensity you have to get clots so someone on birth control may be more likely to clot than the average person. This is something we need more guidance around¡ªif women who are on birth control pills get sick, should they consider stopping the medication and using an alternative method of birth control during that period of time?"
"Is it possible to test negative for COVID-19 and then test positive?
","Using the CDC-developed viral test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the
person¡¯s sample. In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected. For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
"
"Is it possible for animals to carry the COVID-19 virus on their skin or fur?
","Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses,
including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets. However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it¡¯s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.
"
Is it possible to catch CoVID-19 from someone who has no symptoms?,"The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. Many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. "
COVID-19 can be transferred from a mother to her unborn child.,"We still do not know if a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can pass the virus to her foetus or baby during pregnancy or delivery. To date, the virus has not been found in samples of amniotic fluid or breastmilk."
Is it possible for me to attend the church service?,"This is a very personal decision. Certainly a church service involves a risk of infection as many people gather and sit and stand closely to each other. If you weighed the pros and cons carefully and come to the conclusion that attending the service is more important for you than protecting yourself against a possible COVID-19 infection then you are taking an informed decision. If you attend the service, keep as much distance from the other congregants as possible and avoid shaking hands. "
Is it possible for me to get COVID-19 from my pet?,"While there has been?one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to?date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19."
Can I get COVID-19 from someone who has the disease's faeces?,"The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. "
"Is it possible for me to obtain COVID-19 from my pets or other animals?
","At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a signifcant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to
be low. A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after
contact with people with COVID-19.
"
Is it possible to obtain COVID-19 by purchasing used clothing from another country?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 can survive on clothes or other surfaces for some hours, depending on other factors like temperature or humidity. However, if the second-hand clothes came from overseas, they travelled a long time and were disinfected before export as recommended by international standards. This makes it very unlikely that the virus survives in second-hand clothes"
"Can COVID-19 make me sick if it's on my food?
","Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted
through food ¨C additional investigation is needed.
"
"Is it okay if I take my dog on a walk?
","Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being. Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at
least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and
avoid mass gatherings. Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather. To
help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
"
Is the virus that causes COVID-19 spreadable by mosquitoes or ticks?,"At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by
mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person"
"Can individuals expect to be immune to the virus after they've experienced it? Is it possible for the virus to ""reactivate""?","This is unanswered so far. In terms of reports [of potential reactivation] that have come out of Korea, the majority of people in public health and medicine who have been working on COVID believe that this reflects a testing phenomenon. So, when people were retested, they still had the presence of viral RNA in their system but didn¡¯t actually have any replicating virus. There have been a few cases where people were considered ¡°recovered¡± a little too soon and weren¡¯t clear yet. But there has not been compelling evidence of someone getting sick, getting better, and then becoming clinically ill again."
"Is it possible to employ sanitising tunnels at building entrances or exits to prevent COVID-19 from spreading?
","CDC does not recommend disinfection of sidewalks or roads. Spraying disinfectant on sidewalks and roads is not an
e cient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. The risk of
spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not e ective on these
surfaces"
Is it possible to employ sterilizing tunnels at building entrances or exits to prevent COVID-19 from spreading?,"Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have
not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of
that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the
span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure
"
"Is it possible for someone who has had COVID-19 to infect others?
","The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. People are thought to be most contagious when
they are symptomatic (the sickest). That is why it is recommended that these patients be isolated either in the hospital
or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.

"
Is it possible to detect the difference between someone who has an ongoing infection and someone who has been sick in the past using the COVID-19 test?,Current tests for COVID-19 look for the presence of the virus in your body which means there¡¯s an active infection. There is another kind of test called serologic testing which looks for evidence that you may have been infected in the past. 
"Is it possible for the COVID-19 virus to spread through food, such as restaurant takeout, refrigerated or frozen packaged food?
","Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Currently,
there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is
important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety. 
"
Is it possible for the virus that causes COVID-19 to spread through the air?,Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.?
Is it possible for the virus to spread to the lower lungs during deep breathing techniques like yoga?,"There¡¯s no evidence that yoga breathing facilitates the virus going into the deeper parts of the lungs. Once you¡¯re infected with the virus, it¡¯s going to spread in your airways. The way you breathe or don¡¯t breath won¡¯t play much of a role."
Is it possible to avoid contracting the virus by drinking warm water every 15 minutes?,"There¡¯s no evidence behind that claim. Certainly you want to stay hydrated. But there is no evidence at all to support that internet meme telling people that they should only drink warm water, and that if they drink cold water, their lungs will become fibrotic. Stay hydrated, and don¡¯t worry about drinking cold water."
Is it possible to contract Covid-19 several times?,"Medical professionals don¡¯t know. Because COVID-19 is a new virus, it is not yet known if people can develop an immunity to COVID-19 after recovering. Research into this issue is being actively pursued at the moment."
Is it possible to obtain COVID-19 via secondhand smoke?,"If someone is smoking a cigarette and coughing at the same time, maybe, but there¡¯s not a biological mechanism for how the virus would be in the smoke."
Is it necessary for me worry about my children?,"Cases in which children got infected have also been reported. However, children and even youths seem to be much less affected by the Coronavirus Disease than older people."
Does a person's blood type have an impact on how contagious or sick they become?,"There is some emerging data on blood types influencing how severely ill you might get. Blood type O seems to be more protective against severe disease, but this is correlation, not causation, so there would need to be more studies to know definitively"
"To avoid COVID-19, does the CDC advocate wearing a facemask or covering your face?
","In light of data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities
across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the
community setting. This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19
in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions. 
"
Is there a danger of COVID-19 infection from eating bush meat?,"Bush meat is discussed as the possible source of the current Coronavirus pandemic. Coronaviruses and many other pathogens occur naturally in animals. Therefore, the process of meat production from the animals to the plate needs to follow the strict hygiene rules of food safety. Meat should be inspected by the experts in charge and consumers are advised to cook or fry it thoroughly, until it is no longer raw, but well done."
Does the prone body posture in the critical care unit aid very unwell coronavirus patients?,There are reports that this can be helpful and there are more proning studies going on. The challenge with proning is that it is staffing intensive. You need a lot of staff to put people in the proning position and keep them that way¡ªand a lot of PPE to do this safely.
Is it scientifically sound to limit the number of people in grocery shops at any one time?,"Yes. We should be practicing social distancing of at least six feet apart, all the time, including in grocery stores. "
Is the virus affecting your taste buds?,It¡¯s been a reported phenomenon that an important minority of people have lost the sense of smell or taste.
What are the best procedures for firms that stay open to prevent the spread of the virus?,"CDC has released guidelines for infection control in workplaces. These guidelines include the critical guidance that workers with any symptoms of illness should stay home. In addition, businesses that remain open should ensure that customers are maintaining social distancing on their premises. They can do this by limiting the number of people allowed inside at a given time and putting colored tape on floors to help customers keep their distance from one another, as well as cashiers at checkout lines. They can also encourage customers to abide by sanitary guidelines¡ªincluding hand washing and sanitizing and limited touching of products¡ªand offer disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer stations.
"
How are coronaviruses transmitted between people?,"Coronaviruses are typically transmitted from person to person through exhalation of respiratory droplets (from the nose and mouth) and close contact. People can contract COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from an infected person who coughs or exhales droplets. Those droplets can also land on objects and surfaces, and people can then catch the virus from touching those surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. "
What are the differences between COVID-19 and influenza viruses?,The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus.
What are the similarities and differences between COVID-19 and influenza viruses?,"COVID-19 and influenza viruses have a similar disease presentation. That is, they both cause respiratory disease, which presents as a wide range of illness from asymptomatic or mild through to severe disease and death."
What can I do to help people who have COVID-19 avoid being stigmatised?,"Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards people who were quarantined for COVID-19. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about COVID-19 and how it spreads or with gossip and myths.
You can fight stigma and help, not hurt, others by providing social support. You can counter stigma by learning and sharing facts, for example that viruses do not target specific groups in the population."
"What can I do at work to prepare for COVID-19?
","Plan for potential changes at your workplace. Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including
sick-leave policies and telework options. Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
"
"What should I do if my child's school, child care centre, or university is closed?
","Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan. Understand the plan for continuing education and
social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals. If your child attends a college or university,
encourage them to learn about the school¡¯s plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.
"
What can I do to avoid becoming infected?,"The best way to prevent an infection is to avoid exposure to the virus. This can be through thorough hygiene, by avoiding contact with infected people and by keeping a distance of about 6 feet to other people, as the virus spreads mainly from person-to-person and between people who are in close contact with each other. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick."
"How can I protect my child from becoming infected with COVID-19?
","You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone
should do to stay healthy such as; avoiding close contact with people who are sick, stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care, covering your coughs and sneezes, washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects & laundering items
"
What can I do to protect myself from coronaviruses?,"The World Health Organization suggests avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing; covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing; and regular hand washing to protect yourself against infection and limit the spread of the virus.

"
"How will my family deal with the additional strain?
","Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially
during emergency situations. You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your family¡¯s
situation. It is important to continue your family¡¯s coping methods, including reaching out to other family members,
friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past.

"
"What can people do to help combat COVID-19 stigma?
","Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in. Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient. Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.
"
"How should I prepare my children in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak in our neighbourhood?
","Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and
reassure them that they are safe. If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be
mild. Children respond di erently to stressful situations than adults. CDC o ers resources to help talk with children
about COVID-19.
"
How does COVID-19 spread?,"The disease can spread from person to person either directly through small droplets when an infected person sneezes, coughs or exhales. Or people catch COVID-19 when they touch contaminated objects and surfaces and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth thereby transmitting the virus."
"How does the virus spread?
","The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory
droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of
people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact
with one another (within about 6 feet)
"
"Alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high-intensity UV radiation, and LEDs, are they effective?
blue light?
","The e cacy of these disinfection methods against the virus that causes COVID-19 is not known. EPA only recommends
use of the surface disinfectants. At the moment i cannot be confiremd whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be e ective against the spread of COVID-19.
"
How does COVID-19 affect people who don't have spleens? (People without spleens can get very serious infections from certain bacterial diseases.),"There is not specific data around this. In general, we think of people who do not have a spleen or whose spleen is not functioning well as being immunosuppressed. I would be more cautious with those individuals and more aggressive in their care. Those individuals would want to have more social distancing than the average person."
What are my chances of catching COVID-19?,"The risk depends on where you ?are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher."
How long must businesses be closed for disinfection following an exposure? When will other employees be able to return to work?,"Companies do not necessarily need to close after a person with con rmed or suspected COVID-19 has been in a
company facility. The area(s) used or visited by the ill person should be closed for 24 hours or as long as possible.
Open outside doors and windows as much as possible ensuring that doing so does not pose a safety risk to children
using the facility (i.e. make sure that children are not able to enter the closed o area through any windows or doors).
and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Once the area has been appropriately disinfected, it can
be opened for use. Workers without close contact with the person with con rmed or suspected COVID-19 can return
to work immediately after disinfection is completed.
"
What is the duration of the virus's presence on your clothing?,"The coronavirus may remain detectable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials, including clothing. It is not known how infectious this virus is, and it is less infectious over time. In addition, the absorbent fibers in some clothing may cause the virus to dry up more quickly than it does on plastics and metals. Washing clothing is thought to be sufficient to inactivate the virus. Wash clothing on the warmest possible setting appropriate for the material and dry completely. "
What is the virus's shelf life on surfaces?,"Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment)."
"How long does it take for an asymptomatic carrier to shed the virus? Is it possible for them to have it for the rest of their lives, like the herpes virus?",There is no evidence of long-term shedding of virus. Herpes virus is a very different virus.
How long does COVID-19 take to incubate?,The ¡°incubation period¡± means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease.
How safe are Chinese goods?,"Scientific experiments showed that the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive on clothes or other surfaces for some hours, depending on other factors like temperature, humidity and so on. Should goods from China have been contaminated with the virus, they travelled a long time before they arrive in the Africa region. Therefore, it is rather unlikely that the virus is still active. However, should ¡°goods¡± in the local definition also include life animals and should they carry the virus, an infection would theoretically be possible. Therefore, China put into place extensive trade bans on wild and exotic animals."
"How should I assist a sick friend, neighbor, or family member?","If they are ill from coronavirus, you can drop off food or other supplies for them, call them, and make sure they¡¯re coping well. If they are getting sicker, you can help them notify their doctor or local public health agency to arrange for medical care."
"Will I be immune to COVID-19 once I've recovered from it?
","CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once. At this time, we are
not sure if you can become re-infected. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.
"
Is someone at risk if they go for a jog through a neighborhood where there may be a patient with novel coronavirus?,"Majority of transmissions of this virus occur through droplet transmission. This means that a sick patient who coughs or sneezes is expelling virus through droplets that don¡¯t travel that far. They tend to fall to surfaces within a six-foot distance. If you touch a surface that is contaminated with droplets from someone who has coughed or sneezed on it and then you touch your eyes or nose or mouth, you could potentially become infected that way. "
Is it possible for two people who are both positive to quarantine together or must they be separated?,"This is a bit of a trick question: They can be isolated together as long as we¡¯re sure they¡¯re both positive. There¡¯s no problem in having multiple people isolate together. But, ideally, people should quarantine separately. It¡¯s also important to distinguish between isolation and quarantine: isolation is for people who are sick. Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who may have been exposed to the virus."
Do you have to be quarantined if you are tested and the results are negative?,"Yes. The reason is the test measures infection, not exposure. Someone can be exposed on a Monday, not develop an infection yet on a Tuesday and test negative, but then develop a clinical infection on Wednesday and then have a positive test Thursday. So, quarantine needs to last for 14 days regardless of testing results."
"Is cleaning alone effective in combating the COVID-19 virus?
","Cleaning does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. If a
surface may have gotten the virus on it from a person with or suspected to have COVID-19, the surface should be
cleaned and disinfected. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces.
"
Is COVID-19 similar to SARS?,"No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different."
Is hand sanitizer effective in preventing the spread of the coronavirus?,"Good hand hygiene is a way to reduce the possibility of getting infected and plain soap and water is quite effective. But if you¡¯re on the go, hand sanitizer is a good, convenient alternative."
Is interferon Alfa 2B a good treatment option? Is it appropriate for us to encourage our medical community to obtain this?,"There are over 30 treatments currently being tested around the world. Interferon Alfa 2B has historically been used to treat diseases such as dengue fever, HIV, and hepatitis. However, no treatments have been demonstrated to be safe and effective in high quality studies. This treatment, like others, is considered experimental for COVID-19 at this time. "
"Is it true that if someone in your household is sick, you should stay at home as well?","Yes. If people in the home are coughing, have fevers, or other symptoms of the coronavirus, this is good advice. As testing scales up, advice may change. "
Is it all right if I donate blood?,"The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages
people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because
of COVID-19
"
"Is it possible that some people will be exposed to the virus and develop a mild illness, but still produce antibodies that will protect them from a more serious infection?","Yes, and we hope that will happen. We will learn more about this once serologic surveys begin. We need to see what percentage of the population has been exposed by a certain date and then find out if that antibody test correlates with immunity."
"Is it possible to get the flu while also having COVID-19?
","It is possible to test positive for flu (as well as other respiratory pathogens) and the virus that causes COVID-19 at the
same time.
"
Is it safe to seek treatment for my other medical issues at this time?,"It is important to continue taking care of your health and wellness, continue to manage your disease the way your healthcare provider has told you, have at least a 2-week supply of all prescription and non-prescription medications, talk to your healthcare provider, insurer, and pharmacist about getting an extra supply of prescription medications, if possible, to reduce trips to the pharmacy and Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations are up-to-date."
Is receiving a package from an area where COVID-19 has been reported safe?,"Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low.?"
"In terms of COVID-19, is it safe to take public transportation (Dalla Dalla or Matatu)?","Passengers in Matatus or Dalla Dallas are usually squeezed, there is no way of keeping a safe distance from a passenger who¡¯s coughing and sneezing and to avoid contamination by droplets from his/her nose and mouth. Therefore, the use of Dalla Dallas is accompanied by a high risk of infection with COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. If at all possible use other means of transport as long as the outbreak of COVID-19 is ongoing as a preventive measure."
Is my child at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 if he or she has an underlying medical condition or a special healthcare need?,"Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or
emotional di erences, can have special healthcare needs. It¡¯s not known yet whether all of these children are at higher
risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens. 

"
Is the current uptick in cases due to increased testing or to the virus's continued spread? When do you think the curve will flatten?,"We don't know for sure. If you¡¯re increasing testing, you'll find more positives, but that may not be the only factor. Cases are also increasing because the virus is spreading. The most important thing right now is to watch the health care system. If more patients are coming in and they are getting sicker, then you know that the situation is getting worse, regardless of the number of tests."
Is a loss of smell a sign of a coronavirus infection? ,"A temporary loss of smell is relatively common among people who have coronavirus and could be added to a checklist of symptoms to determine whether someone should consider themselves infected. It is not, however, a universal feature of coronavirus infection."
Is the virus safe in the public water supply?,There is no evidence of transmission through the public water supply.
Is it possible to identify the source of COVID-19?,"Currently, the source of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus (CoV) causing COVID-19 is unknown."
Is there a way to get rid of COVID-19?,"There is no specific treatment for COVID-19. Don¡¯t believe people who try to sell you remedies and promise that they will cure the disease. Viral diseases can be prevented if a vaccine is available, but they cannot be cured for example with antibiotics. However, supportive cure or treatment can ease accompanying symptoms, such as fever or cough."
Is there a COVID-19 vaccine available?,"So far, no vaccine is available to prevent COVID-19. Patients will receive supportive care and treatment by the health workers to recovery."
Is there any reason to be concerned about mosquitos carrying the virus?,No. There¡¯s no current evidence to suggest that mosquitoes carry and transmit COVID-19.
Is there evidence that pregnant women are at a higher risk?,"So far, we haven¡¯t seen any particular data that pregnant women are at greater risk. However, there is significant concern that this may be the case."
Is there a vaccine that can be obtained?,"At this time, there is no vaccine for COVID-19.

Researchers around the world are trying to develop a vaccine against the virus responsible for COVID-19, and the World Health Organization is supporting their efforts. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under development and being tested through clinical trials"
"Although many of these viruses are transmitted by bats, bats are immune to them. Is there anything we can learn from bats that will help us fight the virus in humans?","This is an important area of research. There¡¯s a community of wildlife biologists and vets who study bats for that reason and not just for coronaviruses, but for other viruses like Nipah that occur in bats. This research is also important to understand what future diseases we may need to anticipate."
Should I fear COVID 19?,"Every viral disease needs to be taken seriously and COVID-19 is highly contagious. Therefore, it can spread rapidly and infect many people in a short period of time. But, the symptoms of COVID-19 are in most cases mild. Many patients will never even see a doctor. With about 4 % the average death rate for COVID-19 is also rather low compared to other diseases that we are facing in the region"
Persons who are in or have recently visited (within the last 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading should take precautions.,"If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers."
"Is it appropriate for children to wear masks?
","CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when
they are out in the community. Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because
of the danger of su ocation. Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who
has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without
assistance.

"
Should people who wear contact lenses take extra precautions to avoid COVID-19?,"Currently there is no evidence to suggest contact lens wearers are more at risk for acquiring COVID-19 than
eyeglass wearers. Contact lens wearers should continue to practice safe contact lens wear and care hygiene habits to help prevent against transmission of any contact lens-related infections, such as always washing hands with soap and water
before handling lenses.
"
"If I have COVID-19, should I avoid contact with pets or other animals?
","We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations. Until
we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick
with COVID-19, just like you would with people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your
animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet
"
"Is it necessary for me to be tested for COVID-19?
","Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19
"
"Is it necessary for me to continue taking my blood pressure medication?
","Yes. Continue to take your blood pressure medications exactly as prescribed and make lifestyle modi cations agreed
upon in your treatment plan. Continue all your regular medications, as prescribed by your healthcare team
"
"Should I report to work if there is a disease outbreak in my neighborhood?
","Follow the advice of your local health o cials. Stay home if you can. Talk to your employer to discuss working from
home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your child¡¯s school is
dismissed temporarily. Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick
children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.
"
"If I can't find hand sanitizer in stores, should I make my own?
","CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer
with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available. These actions are part of everyday preventive
actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19. When washing hands, you can use plain soap or antibacterial soap. Plain soap is as eat removing germs.ective as antibacterial soap if soap and water are not readily available, you can use an approved alcohol-based hand sanitizer."
"To protect myself from COVID-19, should I wash my hands with soap and water or use a hand sanitizer?
","Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often
with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the
bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand
sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
"
Should I protect myself from the virus by wearing a facemask?,Do not need to wear a facemask unless you are sick or are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Leave the masks to those who really need them.
Should I protect myself by wearing a mask?,"There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely."
Is COVID-19 a cause for concern?,"Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care."
"Should COVID-19 be prevented by cleaning and disinfecting outdoor playgrounds, such as those at schools or in parks?
","Outdoor areas generally require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection. Spraying disinfectant on
outdoor playgrounds is not an e cient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of
COVID-19 to the public. You should maintain existing cleaning and hygiene practices for outdoor areas. If practical,
high touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings, should be cleaned routinely. Cleaning and
disinfection of wooden surfaces (e.g., play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (e.g., mulch, sand) is not
recommended.
"
Should people who are taking immunosuppressive drugs stop taking them?,"They should talk to their doctors. There are different kinds of drugs, and people are on them for different reasons. Some doctors may think the risk benefits suggest they should stop and some will say to continue the medication."
Should people wear bandanas or other makeshift masks to hide their faces?,The CDC now recommends that people without symptoms wear cloth masks in public to reduce the risk of asymptomatic spread. A reasonable position would be to encourage wearing masks while emphasizing that it's social distancing and not just the mask that prevents spread from person to person. 
Should first responders be tested before they begin their shift?,"Many health care settings and other first responders are already actively screening workers for fevers and other symptoms. Over time, testing may become more viable for screening on a routine basis. "
The northern hemisphere has seen more cases than the southern hemisphere. What exactly does that imply?,"The testing capacity in the northern hemisphere is much higher than in the southern hemisphere, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. It¡¯s also possible that the number of travelers between China and the U.S., or China and Europe was greater. This will go away over time as a variable, but it may have made a difference in numbers in the beginning. 

It doesn¡¯t appear that any country is more immune or that a different environment will protect them from this virus. "
"Is it true that if you can hold your breath, you have COVID-19 or not?","There¡¯s no way to tell if you have COVID-19 without a laboratory test. There is some evidence that a CT scan could provide some pictures of your lungs that may raise suspicions, but at this point, the only way we can really tell if you have COVID-19 is if you get a laboratory test."
Was Covid-19 accidentally created in a lab?,"According to the World Health Organization, all available evidence suggests that the novel coronavirus first appeared in China at the end of 2019 and was not manipulated or produced in a laboratory."
"Every year, we get a new flu vaccine with a new strain. Why is obtaining a coronavirus vaccine so difficult?",We use the same flu vaccine strategy every year that¡¯s been developed over many decades. We know the dose of antigen¡ªthe protein¡ªrequired to cause immunity and we know basically how to swap in and out the latest strain to use the same system. We don¡¯t know yet what system will be used to create a COVID vaccine or what vaccine candidates will be safe and not cause side effects. We don¡¯t know what will cause the right level of immunity. We are starting from scratch and have a lot to learn.
"What if you have an underlying medical condition that isn't on this list?
","Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19. CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more. People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned. We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to: Take steps to protect yourself and others. Call your healthcare provider if you are sick with a fever, cough, or shortness of breath


"
"What animals are susceptible to COVID-19?
","We don¡¯t know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. CDC is aware of a small
number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after
close contact with people with COVID-19. A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus. Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus
and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did
not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies

"
"What COVID-19 mitigation measures are being taken by the community?
","Some community mitigation actions may include: washing hands often, avoiding close contact with people who are sick, and practicing social distancing, covering mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others, covering coughs and sneezes, cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces daily
"
"What are randomized control trials, and how do they work?","A randomized control trial is a study design where a patient is randomized to either option 1 or option 2, sometimes multiple options, and sometimes one of those options is a placebo. That study design allows us to control for factors that may influence our ability to see the benefits and the risks associated with something like a treatment. It¡¯s really important in this setting because we don¡¯t know much about COVID-19. The design is how we identify medical countermeasures, vaccines, medications."
"COVID-19 can cause a variety of symptoms and complications.
","People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported ¨C ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.
Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:
Cough, Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, Fever, Chills, Muscle pain, Sore throat, New loss of taste or smell
Children have similar symptoms to adults and generally have mild illness
"
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don¡¯t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing."
What can I do to make my workplace a safer place for myself and my coworker?,"You can reduce working days lost due to illness and stop or slow the spread of COVID-19 if it arrives at your workplaces: Make sure your workplace is clean including surfaces (e.g. desks and tables) and objects (e.g. telephones, keyboards). Wipe them with disinfectant regularly; Encourage regular and thorough hand-washing by staff and visitors; Ensure your workplace has adequate ventilation to allow fresh air to circulate (good respiratory hygiene); Keep your colleagues well about COVID-19 and share any new information. But abstain from spreading rumours that have no underlying facts."
What can I do to protect myself and stop disease from spreading?,Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease if I'm in or have recently visited (within the last 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading?,"Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover."
"What cleaning products should I use to keep COVID-19 at bay?
","Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks,
phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water
prior to disinfection"
"What does it mean to have a well-managed health condition?
","Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and
other ndings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition. You should talk with your healthcare
provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
"
What is the meaning of COVID-19?,The Coronavirus Disease is a flu-like respiratory disease that is highly contagious.
"What does it mean to have a more severe illness? 
","Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your body¡¯s function. You should talk with
your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
"
What does testing tell us about the virus's mortality rate and spread?,"Variations in mortality rates across the world reflect many factors, including the age group most affected, preexisting medical conditions, and the rate of testing. In addition, mortality rates are difficult to determine early in the outbreak because most people are still in the midst of their illness"
What does this imply in terms of a vaccine?,"There are a number of scientific questions related to the vaccine. In general, manufacturers are trying to develop vaccines to parts of the virus that are conserved and not likely to mutate significantly. "
"What if my child requires hospitalization?
","If your child¡¯s healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19 then ask the healthcare provider to let the hospital know you are coming and to share the important information the
hospital will need to know to care for your child
"
"What if my child or another family member becomes ill with COVID-19 symptoms?
","If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your child¡¯s healthcare
provider. If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in
the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call health emergecy services
"
What is a coronavirus?,"Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that typically cause mild respiratory infections like the common cold but also more severe (and potentially deadly) infections. They are zoonotic diseases, meaning they are transmitted from animals to people. "
What is a novel coronavirus?,"A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identied. The virus causing coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause
mild illness, like the common cold.
"
"What is antibody testing? And can I be tested using this method?
","Antibody testing checks a sample of a person¡¯s blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes
COVID-19. These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test
indicates that person was previously infected with the virus. CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured antibody tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers. This evaluation is expected to be completed in early May. We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus (immunity) or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone. Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions. Antibody tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 3 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identi es the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab.
"
"What is the CDC's position on COVID-19?
","CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response. This is an emerging, rapidly evolving
situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available. CDC works 24/7 to protect
people¡¯s health. More information about CDC¡¯s response to COVID-19 is available online.
"
"What is community mitigation?
","Community mitigation activities are actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious
diseases, including COVID-19. Community mitigation is especially important before a vaccine or drug becomes widely
available.
"
"What is community spread?
","Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how
or where they became infected.
"
What is COVID-19?,The Coronavirus Disease is a flu-like respiratory disease that is highly contagious.
What is different about the virus,"The virus responsible for COVID-19 is a new virus and COVID-19 is a new disease. Medical professionals are still learning about what makes it different from the flu and other viruses. On Mar. 4, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the fatality rate with COVID-19 is higher than initially believed and that the virus is more deadly than the flu.

Here are some differences between COVID-19 and the flu:

Rate of infection/transmission. With COVID-19, transmission experts are seeing one person give the virus to 2 to 2.5 people which is higher than the flu.
Incubation time, from exposure to first symptoms. With COVID-19, the incubation time is one to 14 days. The flu has an incubation time of one to four days.
Hospitalization rate. 19% of people with COVID-19 are hospitalized, versus 2% of people with the flu."
"What do we know about how this virus reacts to heat and the possibility of ""seasonality""?","A recent paper by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that ¡°changes in weather alone will not necessarily lead to declines in cases without extensive public health interventions,¡± citing, among other factors, the current rapid spread of the virus in Australia and Iran and the lack of evidence for seasonality in other serious coronaviruses (those causing SARS and MERS). Even if warmer weather weakens the virus, the lack of immunity in the general population will ensure its continued spread. There is no reason at the moment for mayors to expect that warmer weather will slow the virus¡¯ spread. "
What is known about young children in terms of whether they are carriers of the virus and can transmit it?,"Young children can be infected¡ªthis has been established by data from China. The data suggests that in some cases they can get quite ill¡ªparticularly infants. In general, children are not falling ill as frequently as older adults are, but the virus absolutely affects children"
"What is the definition of routine cleaning? How often should facilities be cleaned to prevent COVID-19 from spreading?
","Routine cleaning is the everyday cleaning practices that businesses and communities normally use to maintain a
healthy environment. Surfaces frequently touched by multiple people, such as door handles, bathroom surfaces, and
handrails should be cleaned with soap and water or another detergent at least daily when facilities are in use More handrails, should be cleaned with soap and water or another detergent at least daily when facilities are in use. More
frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use

"
"When it comes to cleaning and disinfecting, what's the difference?
","Cleaning with soap and water removes germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It lowers the risk of spreading
infection. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces. By killing germs on a surface after cleaning, it can further lower the risk
of spreading infection.
"
What is the distinction between molecular and serological tests? Is it possible to use serology tests instead of molecular tests?,"Molecular tests look for evidence of an active infection. Serum antibody tests are a different kind of test that measure the body¡¯s response to infection: antibodies, which take time to develop¡ªabout five days or more after initial infection. There are different kinds of antibody tests. In general, molecular tests and antibody tests are not replaceable with one another, because they measure different things."
What are the chances of getting COVID-19 again after you've recovered?,"It is expected that there will be a low possibility of reinfection, but this is not known yet for sure. There are some reported cases of reinfection. Researchers are working to understand how best to measure immunity using tests of the antibody response. The virus could mutate and come back like flu does, but in that case, it is unlikely to cause illness as severe as the first infection in someone who has previously been infected."
"What are the chances of my child contracting COVID-19?
","Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children
and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. 
"
"What kind of test is used to determine whether I have COVID-19?
","There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has
authorized for use during the current emergency. All of these viral tests identify the virus in samples from the
respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs. Some tests are conducted at the testing site you
visit, and results are available to you within minutes. Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process
that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples
"
What distinguishes this RNA virus-caused upper respiratory infection from the hundreds of other RNA virus-caused upper respiratory infections?,"There are two key differences: First, it¡¯s causing severe disease for individuals which causes big strains on the healthcare system. Second, we just don¡¯t know much about it compared to other RNA viruses that cause upper respiratory infections every day."
What progress has been made on COVID-19 therapies or treatments?,"There are many studies underway. One example is research on convalescent serum, meaning the antibodies made by people who have already recovered from COVID-19. It¡¯s possible that giving these antibodies to people at high risk for exposure (like household contacts or health care workers) or to people early in infection will be beneficial. "
What severe diseases are caused by coronaviruses?,"A coronavirus that originated in China led to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. Another coronavirus emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, causing Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)."
What should I do if my pet becomes ill and I suspect COVID-19 is the cause?,"There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19,
mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you
have about your pets. If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19. Some veterinarians may offer
telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine
the next steps for your pet¡¯s treatment and care.
"
"What should I do if a member of my family becomes ill with COVID-19?
","Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. CDC has directions for people who are recovering at
home and their caregivers, including: staying at home when you are sick, except to get medical care. Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible). Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, washing hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty, providing your sick household member with clean disposable facemasks to wear at home, if available, cleaning the sick room and bathroom and avoiding sharing personal items like utensils, food, and drinks.

"
"What should I do if an outbreak occurs in my neighborhood?
","During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work you should stay home if you are sick, keep away from people who are sick, limit close contact with others as much as possible (about 6 feet), stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation, continue practicing everyday preventive actions - cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, stay in touch with others by phone or email"
"What should people with COVID-19 who are at a higher risk of serious illness do?
","If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should: stock up on supplies, take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others, when you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick, limit close contact and wash your hands often, avoid crowds
"
"What should we do to protect employees at businesses like grocery stores, hotels, and restaurants that are still open?",The CDC has some specific guidance on this. It¡¯s imperative to maintain and enforce social distancing measures. Public spaces should be regularly decontaminated in accordance with the CDC guidelines. Authorities should work to help essential businesses follow the rules. But the most important thing businesses should do is remind workers with any symptoms of illness to stay home
"What can my family do to lower our chances of contracting COVID-19?
","Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do
the same. These include avoiding close contact with people who are sick, staying home when you are sick, except to get medical care, covering your coughs and sneezes,washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, 
cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces and objects (e.g., tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs,
and cabinet handles)

"
"What precautions should parents take to keep their children safe in the event of a community outbreak?
","This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults. However, children do get
the virus and become ill. Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
"
What are the most common symptoms of coronaviruses? What is the severity of the current outbreak's symptoms?,"Common signs of infection include runny nose, cough, fever, sore throat, and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death."
"What are the most common symptoms of coronaviruses? What is the severity of the current outbreak's symptoms?
","Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or
dryer environments. However, we don¡¯t have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-
based cuto for inactivation at this point. The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the
surface, the environment, etc. 
"
What are the treatment options for coronaviruses?,"Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents for coronavirus prevention or treatment, though accelerated research into potential treatments is underway and will be tested through clinical trials. "
What is the difference between COVID-19 and coronavirus?,The novel coronavirus responsible for this outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. The illness caused by the virus is called COVID-19.
When and how should I seek medical attention?,"If you develop any of the following emergency warning signs for COVID-19, get medical attention immediately by calling your doctor's office. Emergency warning signs include (but are not limited to): Trouble breathing, Persistent pain or pressure in the chest, New confusion or inability to arouse, Bluish lips or face"
Is it possible for people who are asymptomatic to spread the virus?,"Yes. This virus has been very hard to control, which suggests asymptomatic transmission, and there have been a number of studies documenting asymptomatic transmission. That¡¯s one reason why you should stay home if someone in your household may have coronavirus infection."
"When Should You Seek Medical Help in an Emergency?
","Look for emergency warning signs for COVID-19 such as trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest
new confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, bluish lips or face
"
Where can I get a COVID-19 test?,"The process and locations for testing vary from place to place. Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial
department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider. State and local public health departments have
received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers."
What are the most effective hygiene measures?,"Clean your hands often by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. You can also use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Rub your hands together until they feel dry. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands."
"Can my child hang out with their friends now that school is out?
","The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. While school is out, children should not
have in-person playdates with children from other households. If children are playing outside their own homes, it is
essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household. 
"
"How can I keep my family healthy while school is out?
","Watch your child for any signs of illness. If you see any sign of illness consistent with symptoms of COVID-19, particularly fever, cough, or shortness of breath, call your healthcare provider and keep your child at home and away from others as much as possible.
"
"Limit your time with older adults, including relatives and people with chronic medical conditions, while school is out.
","Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from
COVID-19.
If others in your home are at particularly high risk for severe illness from COVID-19, consider extra precautions to
separate your child from those people.
If you are unable to stay home with your child during school dismissals, carefully consider who might be best
positioned to provide childcare. If someone at higher risk for COVID-19 will be providing care (older adult, such as a
grandparent or someone with a serious underlying medical condition), limit your children¡¯s contact with other
people.
Consider postponing visits or trip to see older family members and grandparents. Connect virtually or by writing
letters and sending via mail.
"
"Will children be able to eat while school is out?
","Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal. Many schools are keeping
school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
"
Who is at a higher risk of COVID-19-related illness?,"COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on
currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying
medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are: People aged 65 years and older, people who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility, people with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma, people who have serious heart conditions, people with diabetes, people with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis and people with liver disease


"
Who is at risk of contracting a serious illness?,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes)  appear to develop serious illness more often than others. "
Who is most at risk of catching COVID-19?,"All people are at risk once exposed to the virus that causes COVID 19, however, older people, and those with underlying medical conditions like high blood pressure, heart diseases and diabetes or suppressed immune systems, such as people with HIV/AIDS or cancer, are most at risk and more likely to develop serious symptoms."
"Who is responsible for cleaning and disinfecting community spaces?
","Regular cleaning sta can clean and disinfect community spaces. Cleaning sta should be trained on appropriate use
of cleaning and disinfection chemicals and provided with the personal protective equipment (PPE) required for the
chemicals used.
"
Why are reagent shortages interfering with testing?,"It is unclear why these shortages are occurring, but there appears to be a lack of critical supplies needed to deploy the current tests. Addressing these potential shortages and preventing other potential issues that may limit access are urgent priorities."
"Why is there an increase in cases?
","The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported is rising due to increased laboratory testing and
reporting across the the world. 
"
Will this situation change if there aren't enough tests available?,"The major limiting factors are insufficient reagents [the substances used in chemical analysis], swabs, and protective equipment. These shortages are being addressed and more tests are becoming available."
"Why aren't human temperature monitors found in public places such as airports, hospitals, grocery stores, and warehouses?","Taking temperatures is a very insensitive and imprecise tool. People can have elevated temperatures for all sorts of reasons that don¡¯t correlate with illness, such as exercise. People can also suppress their fevers by taking Tylenol or other over-the-counter medications. Having ubiquitous temperature monitors is not likely to be a great benefit and may result in a huge number of false positives and false negatives."
Why do some covid-19 patients require a ventilator?,"Although current data varies by region, early estimates from the World Health Organization estimate that 80 per cent of people who contract COVID-19 will recover without having to go to the hospital. Those who are hospitalized due to more severe illness often need oxygen to help them breathe. In very severe cases, patients experience respiratory failure and need a ventilator. Those with pre-existing health conditions are at a higher risk of experiencing severe illness, but in other cases there is no way to predict who would require ventilator support."
COVID-19 causes shortness of breath for what reason?,"COVID-19 can cause damage to the lungs that impedes their ability to remove oxygen from the air. A lot of patients develop what¡¯s known as severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. And they really benefit from having additional oxygen, particularly in hospital settings."
Why does it take long to develop a vaccine,"Developing a vaccine takes time, in most cases several years, as they need to undergo extensive testing in clinical trials to determine their safety and efficacy."
Why is it called a coronavirus?,"Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word corona, meaning ¡°crown¡± or ¡°halo,¡± because they have ¡°crown-like spikes on their surface,¡± according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
"Why is the disease known as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019)?
","On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an o cial name for the disease that is causing the
2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, rst identi ed in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease
2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ¡®CO¡¯ stands for ¡®corona,¡¯ ¡®VI¡¯ for ¡®virus,¡¯ and ¡®D¡¯ for disease. Formerly, this
disease was referred to as ¡°2019 novel coronavirus¡± or ¡°2019-nCoV¡±.
"
Why is the virus so quick to spread?,There are a couple of factors that help the virus spread quickly. Preliminary information suggests that the virus may persist on many surfaces for several hours or even days. This means that more people can be exposed to the virus than originally thought.
Why is the global response to COVID-19 so much stronger than it is to other epidemics such as H1N1 or SARS?,"COVID-19 is not as deadly as SARS was. On average, SARS killed about 10% of the known cases, and the estimates for this virus are much lower. But the fact that it¡¯s so easily transmissible¡ª much more like a flu than SARS¡ªhas made response to this pandemic quite difficult."
Will I become ill if I assist in their care?,"If you¡¯re caring for them directly without adequate protective equipment, the chance of infection is very high. If people need that extra care, they may need to be hospitalized."
"Will my community's schools be closed if an outbreak occurs?
","Depending on the situation, public health offcials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-
19, such as school dismissals. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for
communication from your child¡¯s school. If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and sta from
gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friend¡¯s house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.
"
"Will the outbreak of COVID-19 be stopped by warmer weather?
","It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those
that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible
to become sick with these viruses during other months. "
"How can we tell people they have coronavirus or have been exposed to it without alarming them, given the limited testing available?","People who have symptoms should assume they have it, isolate themselves from other people, talk to people they may have exposed in the days prior to experiencing symptoms, and recommend that those contacts self-quarantine"
